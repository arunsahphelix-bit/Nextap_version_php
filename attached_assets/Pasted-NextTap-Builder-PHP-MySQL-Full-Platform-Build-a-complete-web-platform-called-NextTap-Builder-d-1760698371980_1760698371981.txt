NextTap Builder (PHP + MySQL Full Platform)

Build a complete web platform called NextTap Builder, designed for shared hosting environments like MilesWeb (only PHP + MySQL supported).
The system combines a digital NFC profile builder, custom NFC card order portal, and a mini website builder with 7 pre-designed templates — all in one platform.
No Node.js, no external build tools. Use pure PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap or Tailwind, and vanilla JavaScript with AJAX.

💾 Database Structure (MySQL)

Create these core tables:

users → id, name, email, password, company_name, verification_status, otp_code, created_at

profiles → id, user_id, profile_name, about, contact_info, social_links, image, theme_id, is_public

nfc_orders → id, user_id, type (‘profile’ | ‘custom’), selected_profile_id, uploaded_design, requirements, business_proof, status, created_at

otp_verifications → id, user_id, otp, verified, created_at

websites → id, user_id, template_id, domain_name, website_title, content_json, status

analytics → id, profile_id, total_views, total_taps, last_viewed_at

🔑 Core Modules
1. User Authentication & Verification

Signup, Login, Logout system

OTP verification via company email using PHPMailer (SMTP)

Unverified users can’t place orders or publish websites

Password hashing via PHP password_hash()

2. Profile Builder

Users can create & edit professional NFC-ready digital profiles

Add name, title, company, about, links, images, logo, and contact details

Each profile shows analytics (views, taps, clicks)

Allow user to select themes/layouts for profile (3–4 predesigned styles)

3. NFC Card Ordering System

User chooses between:

Use existing profile → tapping NFC opens their built profile

Custom NFC card → user uploads design, fills custom request form, and uploads business proof

Orders saved in nfc_orders table

Email notification on order placement and admin approval

4. Email OTP Verification System

OTP sent to user’s company email after signup

OTP stored in otp_verifications table

Once verified, user status updates in users.verification_status

5. Admin Dashboard

Manage users, profiles, websites, and orders

Approve/reject NFC orders

Verify uploaded designs and proofs

See analytics and active users

Manually send approval emails
